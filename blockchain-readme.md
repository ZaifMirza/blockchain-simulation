# Blockchain Simulation Project

## Overview
A Python-based blockchain simulation demonstrating core blockchain concepts, 

including:
- Block creation and chaining
- Cryptographic hashing
- Proof-of-Work mechanism
- Chain integrity validation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-simulation.git
   cd blockchain-simulation
   ```

2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python blockchain.py
   ```

## Key Features
- Genesis block creation
- Dynamic block addition
- SHA-256 hashing
- Proof-of-Work mining
- Chain integrity validation
- Tampering detection

## Blockchain Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Block Structure**
   - Index
   - Timestamp
   - Transactions
   - Previous block hash
   - Current block hash

2. **Proof-of-Work**
   - Computational puzzle
   - Hash difficulty adjustment
   - Nonce-based mining

3. **Chain Validation**
   - Hash integrity check
   - Previous block link verification

## Example Output
```
Block mined: 0000bccaebaecf85e12939c26930bf44564f7f850cdbf6fceefc1f96f93ec8f9
Blockchain Valid: True
Tampering Detected: False
```

## Customization
- Adjust mining difficulty in `mine_block()` method
- Modify transaction structure
- Implement more complex validation logic


The README now focuses solely on the Python-based implementation.
